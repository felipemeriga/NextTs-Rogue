# Class 2 - Installing the dependencies

### [SWITCH TO PORTUGUESE VERSION](./PT.md)

## Dependencies

In order to have our project up and running in a fashion way, we will need the help of third party dependencies and
libraries, and the used ones are:

-   [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): Library used for doing HTTP/HTTPS requests.
-   [axios-mock-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-mock-adapter): Used for creating mocks HTTP requests for our
    application.
-   [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose): For interacting with the database.
-   [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): Used for exposing HTTP endpoints as the API server.
-   [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form): Used to create hooks with our forms.
-   [react-query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query): Used for creating hooks and state management for each of the
    components.

## Installing Node and NPM

In order to install the dependencies and get all the Javascript modules you would need to install Node and NPM, you can
find the installation of it, for any operational system, in this link bellow:

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

## Installing the Dependencies of the Project

After installing NPM, the dependencies needed for that project are all in the [package.json](./package.json) file, we
just need to execute NPM to install everything.

Run this command on the root path of your project:

```shell
npm install
```

NPM will fetch all the dependencies inside [package.json](./package.json).

## Testing ESlint and Prettier

We are going to be using ESLint, which is a linting and code correction tool and
Prettier, which is a formatting tool. Those tools will be able to help us in maintaining everything 
clear, organized and formatted. Also, we are using this so you can get used to those tools, to 
your next projects, where code quality, and enhancing syntax quality, it's a very good practice.

ESlint and Prettier are configured in the respective files:
- [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json)
- [.prettierrc.json](.prettierrc.json)

In the recorded class, you would be able to have a deep understand of each of them.

Those two tools are already defined in the [package.json](package.json), if you have executed the last
step, they will be already installed, let's test them now.

For testing if those tools are working properly, create a file named index.tsx under [pages](./pages), directory, and
paste the following content:

```typescript jsx
import React from 'react'

const Index: React.FunctionComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div title="Home">
            <h1>Hello Next.js ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        </div>
    )
}

export default Index
```

If you change the formatting of the file, or by purpose force some error, you will see that
ESLint will point out it to you, also another thing that we can do, it's running the lint in our
command line, so all the files of the project will be verified, also ESLint is already 
integrated with Prettier, which means that the linting command formats the code automatically too.

You can run it by:
```shell
npm run lint
```

You will see that all the files get formatted, and possible errors raised by ESLint.
